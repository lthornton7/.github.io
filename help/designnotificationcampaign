## Designing a Notification Campaign ##

Notification campaigns are a set of specifications that can:

  *  notify users about a specific event,
or to highlight an Offer or Offer Campaign. Notification campaign APIs offer a useful service that can
intersect with Offers and Offer Campaigns to highlight specific Offers or other events targeted to
specific groups of users.The methods in this chapter are used to create and manage these kinds of
Notification campaigns.
The Notification APIs can be used to:
• Target a specific subset of users based on location.
• Define a list of customer IDs that can be assigned by Paydiant or by an external party, such as a
merchant.
• Specify the message provided in the notification.
• Define how the notification is delivered.
• Set target dates to indicate when the notification are sent to targeted customers.
The Notification campaign has three components:
1 Campaign specification - a series of parameters that define the campaign which are processed into a
unique URI.
2 Customer target specification - the parameters that identify the users being sent this notification which is
processed into a unique customer targeting spec URI.
3 File processing - definitions of how the generated customer file and notification details will be processed
and uploaded to Paydiant to be ultimately sent to the targeted users as a notification on their phones.
The following APIs are used to define, query, and upload the components needed
