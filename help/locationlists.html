# Location Lists #
Location lists allow you to manage your offer targeting location(s) in a more natural way. You can aggregate different merchants, merchant locations, or even remove specific locations to create a specific targeted list. Lists can be saved, reused, edited and deleted.

<br/> 

When an offer is created the targeting location(s) or merchants are sent to the Offer Manager platform. Your location lists are never sent to the platform. This means you can created, edit, and update your lists and those changes will *NOT* impact any existing offers. Lists are just a way for you to manage your locations data.

<br/> 
    
Lists can be managed in the normal create campaign flow or from the Location Lists option of the Manage pull down menu.


## Managing Lists ##
    
1. From the main header click the Manage pull down.
2. Select the Location Lists option.

The following fields are available:
| Field | Instructions |
| ------ | ----------- |
| **Select Location List** | From the drop down menu select an existing location list to edit. |
| **Create New** | Click this link to create a new location list. You will be able to add locations from existing lists, available merchants or file upload. |
| **Upload List** | Upload a list of merchant location URIs to create your list from. |


### Create New 
The following fields are available:
| Field | Instructions |
| ------ | ----------- |
| **List Name** | This is how your list will appear in the drop down. The name must be unique. |
| **Search (icon)** | This will reveal a search input box. You can search all the locations in the current list. Search results can be cleared by emptying the search box and hitting enter. |
| **Add Locations** | This will allow you to add new locations to your list. |
| **Remove Selected** | This will remove those locations that are checked from your list. |
| **Remove All** | This will remove all locations from the list. |  
<br/> 
    
**SAVE** button will save your new list with the supplied name. **All** locations in the list will be saved, regardless of their checked or unchecked state. Remove any locations you do not want before saving your list.

**CANCEL** button will exit the list creation UI.

### Upload List
This will allow you to upload a CSV file that contains merchant location URIs. The list must contain nothing except for the location URIs. All URIs will be validated after the file is uploaded. You must choose to save the uploaded data as a new list or it will be lost.
