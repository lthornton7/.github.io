## Managing users ##

The Campaign Portal uses a role-based security access system to manage the access that each individual Campaign Portal user has to the portal and its functions.

The Ad Network Administrator creates and maintains the user accounts that can access the Campaign portal based on their assigned roles. 

hiddenanchor {.anchor #roles}

### Security user roles ###

There are multiple roles in the Campaign Portal that can be used to manage the access a specific user has to different parts of the portal.
- Ad Network Admin - creates users for the Ad Network and edits user roles within the Ad Network. Can also create and activate offers for all Merchants in an Ad Network.
- Portal User - designs offers. Can also publish offers if the Ad Network does not have an Approver user. Within the Ad Network, the portal user is assigned a Merchant on which the portal user can operate. The Portal User is limited to working on offers only for their own Merchant within the Ad Network.
- Approver - approves offers for all campaigns in the specified Ad Network. Can also create and edit offers for all Merchants in the Ad Network. Not required for an Ad Network, but if a user is assigned the Approver role, then all offers within that Ad Network must be approved before they can be published.

Every user in the Campaign Portal has at least one role assigned to them. Users can also have multiple roles. Parts of the portal are hidden from users without the proper role access. For example, the Portal User cannot make any changes to the Advertising Network.

Ad Network Admins can find out which role an existing user has on the **Manage Users** page. 

Using these roles, a merchant can allocate the jobs of designing, managing, and approving offers to different users. Or a merchant can assign a single user all the roles so that the same person manages all aspects of offer management. All user roles identify the Ad Network with which they are associated. In addition, Portal Users are linked to specific Merchants. 

Paydiant also maintains the Network Administrator role which is the only user who can create or remove Advertising Networks or add to or remove Merchants from an Ad Network. Before you can use the Campaign Portal to design offers, the Merchants and Locations you need must be onboarded to the Paydiant Platform by the Paydiant Network Administrator.

hiddenanchor {.anchor #createuser}

### Create a new user ###

The Ad Network Admin can create new Campaign Portal users within that Ad Network. 

1. Log into the Campaign Portal as the Ad Network Admin for the Ad Network where the new user will design offers. 
2. Click **Manage** and select *User Accounts*.
3. Click **+ Create New User**.
4. On the **Create New User** screen, enter the information as appropriate for this user. All fields except the Contact Number are required.
5. When you have entered the information for this user, click the **Create User** button to save the new user or click the **Cancel** button to cancel creation of the user.
    
| Field | Instructions |
| ------ | ----------- |
| Role  | Use the drop-down menu to choose the selected roles for this user. The Ad Network Admin can create or assign an additional Ad Network Admin, portal users, approvers, or push notification users. Approvers are optional for an Ad Network so you do not need to assign that role to any user in the Ad Network. But if any Approver is assigned within an Ad Network, all offers generated in that Ad Network must be approved before the offers can be made available. If an Approver is required for an offer, the final button choice when you design the offer is **Send for Approval.** Otherwise the final button is **Activate Offer.** |
| Merchant   | The Advertising Network is automatically displayed. If the role chosen requires identification of the Merchant, choose the Merchants for which this user can create offers. |
| Username | Enter an account username that the user will use to log in. Username must be a string of up to 15 characters that is unique within the Paydiant Campaign Portal and are case-sensitive.|
| Email| Enter the email address where correspondence, such as approval notifications from the Campaign Portal, are sent. |
| Contact Number | Enter a phone number where the user can be contacted. Do not use dashes. |
|Password | Enter a password for this user to use when logging into the Campaign Portal. Current requirements for passwords are: 8 - 20 characters, contain an upper-case letter, a lower-case letter, a number or one of these special characters: !@#$%^&*()|
|Confirm Password | Re-enter the same password. If the confirmation does not match the original, the user is not created. |

    
hiddenanchor {.anchor #edituser}

### Edit an existing user  ###

Once a Campaign Portal User is created, the Ad Network Admin can change certain details about the user.

To change something about a Campaign Portal user, 

1. Use **Manage** then **User Accounts** (only Ad Network Admins can edit users). 
2. To find a particular Username,  enter the username or a string in the Search box and click **Search**. Other columns display some other information about the user; however, only the Username field is used for searching.
3. When the Username you need displays, click the name in the UserName column. 
4. Click the **Edit** button.

You can change the following details about the user:

|You want to | Instructions |
| ------ | ----------- |
| Change security roles for this user  | Use the drop-down to display and check or uncheck the roles. Users can have more than one role. |
| Change the set of Merchants that this user can work with |The Advertising Network for this user display but that cannot be changed. Select or unselect Merchants from the drop-down.|

|Enable User | If you want this user to be able to login and begin working immediately, set to **Yes** which is the default. When set to **No**, the user is on the system but cannot perform any activity. This can be useful when you want to add users but have a future date when they can begin working on offers. This status is also useful in the event that an employee no longer works for the company, but you would like to retain the account for historical and troubleshooting purposes.|
| Expire Account| Set to **No** by default. Although the full functionality of this feature is not yet available, if this option is set to **Yes** the user cannot login or perform any activity. When this option is set to **Yes,** changing the password for this user will re-activate the user. |
