| Field | Instructions |
| ------ | ----------- |
| Security Role | Use the pull-down to select, add, or remove the roles for this user.|
| Merchant | This user's Advertising Network displays here but you cannot edit it. The pull-down shows any Merchants that have been linked to this user. When you select a Merchant here, you enable that user to edit offers for that Merchant. You can remove that permission here by clearing the checkbox for the appropriate Merchant.|
| Username and Contact Info | Network Admins can edit the username, email, and contact number stored for this user.|
| Change Password | For security purposes the *Change Password* field does not display unless you click it. Once clicked, you can change the password and confirm it here.|
| Enable User | If you want this user to be able to login and begin working immediately, set to **Yes** which is the default. When set to **No**, the user is on the system but cannot perform any activity. This can be useful when you want to add users but have a future date when they can begin working on offers. This status is also useful in the event that an employee no longer works for the company, but you would like to retain the account for historical and troubleshooting purposes.|
| Expire Account | Set to **No** by default. Although the full functionality of this feature is not yet available, if this option is set to **Yes** the user cannot login or perform any activity. |
| Lock Account | Set to **No** by default. Although the full functionality of this feature is not yet available, if this option is set to **Yes** the user cannot login or perform any activity. |
| Expire Password | Set to **No** by default. Although the full functionality of this feature is not yet available, if this option is set to **Yes** the user cannot login or perform any activity.|
