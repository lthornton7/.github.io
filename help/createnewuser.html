## Create a new user ##

The Ad Network Admin can create new Campaign Portal users within that Ad Network. 

1. Log into the Campaign Portal as the Ad Network Admin for the Ad Network where the new user will design offers. 
4.  Click **Manage** and select *User Accounts*.
5.  Click **+ Create New User**.
6.  On the **Create New User** screen, enter the information as appropriate for this user. All fields except the Contact Number are required.
    
| Field | Instructions |
| ------ | ----------- |
| Role  | Use the drop-down menu to choose the selected roles for this user. The Ad Network Admin can create or assign an additional Ad Network Admin, portal users, approvers, or push notification users. Approvers are optional for an Ad Network so you do not need to assign that role to any user in the Ad Network. But if any Approver is assigned within an Ad Network, all offers generated in that Ad Network must be approved before the offers can be made available. If an Approver is required for an offer, the final button choice when you design the offer is **Send for Approval.** Otherwise the final button is **Activate Offer.** |
| Merchant   | The Advertising Network is automatically displayed. If the role chosen requires identification of the Merchant, choose the Merchants for which this user can create offers. |
| Username | Enter an account username that the user will use to log in. Username must be a string of up to 15 characters that is unique within the Paydiant Campaign Portal and are case-sensitive.|
| Email| Enter the email address where correspondence, such as approval notifications from the Campaign Portal, are sent. |
| Contact Number | Enter a phone number where the user can be contacted. Do not use dashes. |
|Password | Enter a password for this user to use when logging into the Campaign Portal. Current requirements for passwords are: 8 - 20 characters, contain an upper-case letter, a lower-case letter, a number or one of these special characters: !@#$%^&*()|
|Confirm Password | Re-enter the same password. If the confirmation does not match the original, the user is not created. |
`7.  ` Click the **Create User** button to save the new user or click the Cancel button to cancel creation of the user.
    
##Editing Users##

Once a Campaign Portal User is created, the Ad Network Admin can change certain details about the user.

3. When the Username you need displays, click the name in the UserName column. 
4. Click the **Edit** button.
