## Designing a Notification Campaign ##

Notification campaigns are a set of specifications that can notify users about a specific event, or they can highlight an Offer or Offer Campaign.

The notification campaign can:

  - Target a specific subset of users based on location.
  - Define a list of customer IDs that can be assigned by Paydiant or by an external party, such as a merchant.
  - Specify the message provided in the notification.
  - Define how the notification is delivered.
  - Set target dates to indicate when the notification are sent to targeted customers.

The Notification campaign has three components:

1. **Campaign** specification - parameters that define the campaign. These parameters get processed into a unique campaign URI that identifies this notification campaign.
2. **Customer target specification** - these parameters identify the users who will get this notification. These parameters are also processed into a separate, unique customer targeting spec URI.
3. **File processing** - defines how the generated customer file and notification details will be prepared and uploaded to Paydiant. Paydiant then generates the notifications and sends them to the specified users as notification messages on their phones.

### Pre-Requisites ###

Be sure these components are in place:

  - The AdNetwork associated with the user is an **IssuerPartner** type. The notifications are managed using the issuer's wallets.
  - The appropriate merchants are associated with the AdNetwork.
  - The user has the Notification security role.
  - If you want someone to approve the Notification campaign before it is processed, you can optionally also create a Notification Approval User. Just like Offer Campaigns, if there is no Notification Approval User defined for the Notification campaign, the Notification User can submit the campaign without anyone else approving it.

## Define the campaign ##

1. Login with the notification user userid and password.
2. If your security role only allows you to work on Notification campaigns, the Notification login screen appears. If you have other portal roles, use the pull-down on the left side of the opening panel to select **Notification Campaign**.
3. Click **New Campaign**.
4. On the **Create a New Message Campaign**, enter the **Campaign Name** and **Campaign Description**.
5. Enter the text to be sent in the **Message Copy** area.
6. Set the date to send the notification in the **Send messages on** prompts.
7. If the notification uses an External ID, enter it in the **Campaign External ID** area.
8. Depending on the type of notification, you may need to enter **Key** and **Value** content--your notification type determines if you need these.
9. The notification may also require special **iOS** or **Android** settings, such as localization keys, which can be entered by first using the **on/off** slider to reveal the available types of settings. Refer to your iOS and Android notification documentation for details on which settings you need and how to complete them.
10. When you have completed all of the fields needed, click **Next**.
