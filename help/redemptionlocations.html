## Targeting redemption locations ##

By default all mobile wallet users can redeem the offer at any location associated with the Merchants identified in the campaign, regardless of where those Merchant locations are.  However, if you want to target certain Merchant locations as a way to incentivize sales at that location, the campaign can instead identify only specific Merchant locations where mobile wallet users will be able to redeem this offer.

You can define the locations where the offer can be redeemed in different ways. You can 

- Add all the locations for specific Merchants 
- Include or exclude entire Merchants 
- Specify a customized list of locations within a Merchant based on geography or other criteria.

| Field | Description |
| ------ | ----------- |
|Use all Merchants|Click **All Merchant Locations** to include *all* the locations for *all* the Merchants associated with this offer|
|Specify individual locations| To pick and choose the Locations, first click **Select Merchant Locations.** By default, all Merchants associated with this offer are set to **Yes** which, at this point, is the same as choosing **Use all Merchants.** To define a reduced set of locations for a particular Merchant, first set that Merchant to **No.** A grid of those locations displays. To find all the locations of a particular city, for example, first filter the list using the pull-downs. You can filter by *Merchants,* *Names,* *Cities,* *States,* or *Zips.* Then check the locations that should be included.  All other locations for that Merchant will not be included in this offer. If you decide to include all the locations after all, you can set that location to **Yes.** The locations for that Merchant will disappear from the grid and all that Merchant's locations will receive the offer.|

## Specifying a redemption schedule ##

The **When will your offer be valid** portion of the screen defines the Redemption Specification for the offer. The Redemption Specification encompasses the span of dates when qualified mobile users can redeem this offer. By default, the Redemption Specification defaults to use a schedule of 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. If you prefer, you can define a detailed **Redemption Schedule** within that span of time to more precisely identify when the offer can be redeemed.

To use the default Redemption Specification, click the calendar icon and select the start and end dates. The box displays the criteria of the default specification.

To refine the Redemption Schedule by day of the week or date of the month, click the **Clock** icon.

You need a separate redemption schedule for each day of the week or date of the month so that the dates encompass the entire redemption date span. For example, to have an offer redeemable Monday through Friday, add 5 separate schedules, one for Monday, one for Tuesday, one for Wednesday, etc. Each day schedule defines the redemption hours for that day.

If the dates you entered fully encompass the Redemption Specification span, the message *Schedule successfully saved* message displays. The message *There are invalid redemption schedule days between Offer Start Date and Offer End Date.* indicates you have not set enough schedules to encompass the entire redemption specification date span. Return to the schedule screen and add the additional schedules needed to fill in the Redemption Specification date span.

Dates and times refer to Coordinated Universal Time (UTC). To check the UTC time in other time zones, click the **UTC** question mark. This displays the EST, CST, MST, and PST times for the currently set UTC time.
 
| Field | Description |
| ------ | ----------- |
|When will your offer be valid?| Enter a start and end data for the span of time when the offer can  be redeemed. You can enter the dates or use the calendar popup, hour, and minute pull-down. The results display in sentence format in the box as *24 hours a day, 7 days a week, Every day of the month.* |
|Clock| To refine a Redemption Schedule range more precisely or to set individual dates, click the **Clock** icon. Use the pull-downs to select the day of the week or date of the month, then set the times. Click **Save** to store that portion of the schedule. Use the **+** to add another schedule for another day or date until all the valid dates of the offer are defined. Save each schedule as you construct it. When the entire Redemption Specification Schedule time span is covered, click **Next**|
