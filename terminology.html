## Terminology ##

The following terms are used throughout the Offer Campaign Help system.

#### Activate ####
Indicates the state of the offer campaign when mobile users are able to use the offer. You activate the offer campaign when the details of an offer campaign are completed in the Campaign Portal and the campaign is ready to be used. Mobile wallet users will receive the offer when the appropriate dates and eligibility requirements are met. Also called “publish” or “Go Live.”

#### Issuing Partner (Issuers) ####

A business partner that designs and releases a mobile wallet so that mobile wallet users can use their phones to pay at specific Merchants (Acceptance Partners). An Issuer subscribes to an Advertising Network so that any offers that are made available within that Ad Network are available to the Issuer's mobile wallet users. 

#### Acceptance Partner (Merchant) ####

A business partner that uses the Paydiant Platform to accept payments for the business partner’s own Point of Sale (POS) system. Also called a Merchant. If the business builds its own wallet and also uses the Paydiant Platform for payments, it can be both an Issuing Partner and an Acceptance Partner (Merchant) within the Paydiant Platform.

#### Acceptance Location ####

A single location associated with a Merchant that accepts a wallet, for example, a single store. When there is only one location, the Acceptance Location is also referred to as the Merchant or Retailer. 

#### Customer ####

The mobile wallet user. Also called “user” or “consumer.” 

#### Advertising Network ####

The collection of Merchants with a shared advertising interest. Used as the organizing principal for offer campaigns. Issuers subscribe to a network so that their mobile wallet users can receive any offers published within that Ad Network.

#### Merchant ####

A business partner with an agreement to accept mobile payments using the Paydiant Platform. Also called an Acceptance Partner.

#### Network Administrator ####

The Paydiant Administrator who manages all the Advertising Networks for all partners across the entire Campaign Portal. The Network Administrator associates Merchants with a particular advertising network and activates the subscriptions of Issuing Partners. This role is managed exclusively by Paydiant.

#### Subscription ####

An agreement the Issuer has made in advance to be a part of a specific Advertising Network.  Typically, an Issuer subscribes to the Advertising Network that is associated with the Merchants that accept the Issuer’s mobile wallet.
