## Managing an Offer Campaign  ##  

Once a campaign has been created, you can view it in the main Campaign Portal Dashboard. From any screen, click **Campaign Portal** to display the main dashboard.

To reduce initial performance demands, no campaigns display when you initially open the main Campaign Dashboard.

To locate a particular campaign, first select the status:

|Status| Description |
| ------ | ------- |
| Active | Campaign is available for use by the mobile wallet users.|
| Pending | Campaign has been created, is not yet active. |
| Expired | The Campaign redemption dates have all passed. |
| Approval | The Campaign requires an Approval sign off on the campaign before it can become active. |

Once a status is selected, you can sort the display in ascending or descending order by campaign Name or Offer Title and by start and end date using the Sort by pull-down.

Or use the search box to enter a search to locate a specific campaign by campaign name within the display.

The main Dashboard display shows some of the main details about the offer including how many locations and Merchants (Acceptance Partners) are part of the campaign.

You cannot edit campaigns that have already been approved, are active, or are expired. 

To take action on the campaign, click the Settings icon and select from these actions:

|Status| Description|
| ------ | ------- |
|Preview | The preview provides most of the details set for the campaign. You can also click **Full Preview** to see a representation of the campaign on different devices.|
| Edit | Depending on the status of the offer, and your role you may be able to change certain aspects of the offer from here. Clicking **Edit** returns you to the Create a Campaign screen where you can walk through the settings for this offer and make changes. Note you cannot edit a rejected or expired campaign. And the following fields cannot be edited in a Live campaign: Offer Campaign name, External ID, Processing Type, Minimum Purchase, Discount, Terms and Conditions, or Targeted Customers.|
| Targeting | Select Targeting to return to the Targeting screens to change details about targeting users for this offer.|
| Duplicate | Select Duplicate to create a copy of an existing offer so you can then edit some aspects of it. The newly-created offer displays in the **Pending** list.|
| Delete | To remove a campaign from the system, select it then clcik **Delete**. Live campaigns cannot be deleted.|
| Expire | For active campaigns, a choice of **Expire** displays. **WARNING** Setting a campaign to *Expire* prevents any users from redeeming the offers, even those users who have already taken the offer but have not yet redeemed it. If you want to prevent further redemptions in a campaign, instead set the **Total activations** to a lower number so that no further offers can be downloaded or redeemed. The campaign's status is triggered by a mobile user accessing the campaign so the change in status to *Expired* will not be reflected in the portal until a phone attempts to access the expired campaign. |

hiddenanchor {.anchor #previewoffer}

## Preview an Offer Campaign   ##  

The Preview display shows a brief list of the essential components of the offer. You can also edit most of the details here by clicking on them. The preview feature is intended to give you an idea of how the offer will appear in the mobile wallet app. It is not an exact match. Two different sizes of images are available to accommodate older phones. Also, if you are using your own app instead of Paydiantâ€™s branded app, the preview may not provide an exact match to the way the finished offer will display.

|You can|Action |
| ---- | -----|
|See how the offer will look on different devices | Click **Full Preview** to display a rendering of the three ways to view the Offer (list, narrow list, and summary)  and the Offer Details. Use the pull-down to change the device from **iOS** to **Android**|
|Send the offer for Approval | If this Ad Network requires approval, the **Send for Approval** button displays. Click that button to store the campaign and send an email to the Approver user telling that user that a campaign is awaiting approval.  In this state you can see the campaign in the campaign list by clicking **Pending.**|
|Make offer ready| If the Ad Network does not have a user role of Approver, the **Save as Pending** button is the only one that displays. Click it to store any changes you made and make the campaign ready for when the redemption dates roll around. Until the campaign is active, you can see the campaign in the campaign list by first clicking **Pending**. Once it is active, use **Active** to find this campaign.|
|Save changes but not send for Approval| On campaigns that require approval, you can click **Save as Pending** to store the changes but return another time to click **Send for Approval.**|
|Return to another part of the campaign| Click any of the Progress bar at the top of the preview to return to that section of the campaign. If you edit any of these values, click **Next.** and continue through the process.|

## Edit an Offer Campaign   ##  

Select **Edit** to return to the first panel of the Create a Campaign screens. You can make changes here and click **Next** to advance through the screens.

See [Creating an Offer Campaign](createnewoffer.html?dt=#createnewoffer) for details how to construct an offer.

hiddenanchor {.anchor #targetingofferedit} 

## Target an Offer Campaign ##

Click **Targeting** to return to the user targeting screen of the Create a Campaign screens.  

See [Targeting customers](createnewoffer.html?dt=targetcustomers) for details.

hiddenanchor {.anchor #duplicateoffer} 

## Duplicate an Offer Campaign    ##
    
Click **Duplicate** to create a copy of an existing campaign that is populated with the values from the original campaign as a starting point for a new campaign. 

A new campaign name is the only required field for the duplicate, however, the pop-up offers the Campaign Description, and Offer Start and End Dates immediately as well. Once you have clicked **Create Duplicate,** you can go to the **Pending** campaign list and make any further changes that may be required. Then edit the campaign as needed.
    
hiddenanchor {.anchor #deleteoffer}

## Delete an Offer Campaign ##

To delete an offer campaign:
1. From the Offer Campaign List page, click the trashcan icon in the far right of the row of the offer you wish to delete.
2. Click **OK** in the dialog to confirm the deletion.

Deletetion removed the campaign from the portal. 

You can use the number of activations to halt a live campaign. If you make the total number of activations less than the number of activations that have already occurred, no further activations will be permitted. This technique can be used if a campaign has a mistake in it. Resetting the activation total is often preferable to deleting a campaign because once a campaign is deleted it is removed from the portal and cannot be used as the basis for a duplicate offer.

See [Number of activations](createnewoffer.html?dt=activations) for details.


hiddenanchor {.anchor #approveoffer}

## Approve an Offer Campaign  ##

If the Advertising Network has a user with the Offer Approver role, all campaigns constructed in that Ad Network require approval before they can be made active. This option enables a separate pair of eyes on the the campaign before sending the offers into the mobile user's hands. 

The *Preview* and *Edit* screens have **Send for Approval** as a button at the end of the Offer Campaign construction screens along with **Save as Pending**. When **Send for Approval** is clicked, and email is sent to the Offer Approver asking that the campaign be approved. 

When any authorized Approver approves the offer, the campaign is automatically activated and the offer creator is notified via email.

More than one Offer Approver role can be assigned in an Ad Network. In that case, all Offer Approvers receive an email about campaigns that are awaiting approval. Any Approver in that Ad Network can approve any campaign within the Ad Network.

Note: In order for the campaign to be approved, the Start date of the campaign must be a current or future date. If it is not, an error message displays and the campaign remains in a pending state. The Approver can use the **Preview** or **Edit** option to go back to the campaign and adjust the Redemption Dates then send for Approval again.

A Message displays of "Campaign created successfully" when the offer is activated. The campaign moves to  the **Active** status list and displays 

- a running count of the Redemptions
- the number of offers *Saved* to a mobile wallet
- If a *Total Activations Available* was set, it displays a countdown total of still available activations  (*AVL*)
- the number of offers that were deleted out of a user's wallet.

hiddenanchor {.anchor #rejectoffer}

## Reject an Offer Campaign  ##

When an Approver is sent a campaign to approve, the Approver can instead click **Reject** to send the campaign back into the Pending state. The Portal User can then change it as needed before submitting it for Approval again.

When an Approver rejects a campaign, a popup prompts the user to enter a reason for the rejection. That information is included in an email sent to the Portal User.
